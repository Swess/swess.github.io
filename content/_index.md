<mark>The site is still gradually being populated as I slowly add multiple relevant projects I've worked on in the past.</mark>

I’m a software engineer based in Canada, specializing in interactive and real-time systems. My work sits at the crossroads of technology, high-performance software, and art—rooted in a long-standing fascination with computer graphics and the systems that make them possible.

With over 12 years of experience in software development, I’ve explored everything from rendering techniques and low-level systems programming to game jams and experimental projects. My professional work has often involved proprietary engines and unreleased software, so this site serves as a place to share select personal [projects](/projects), technical experiments, tools, and visual work.

I’m continually exploring new approaches to graphics, performance optimization, and game programming, and I plan to add more software projects, tutorials, and technical deep dives here over time.
