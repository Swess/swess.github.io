**Current project**  
Got really tired of the Unity/Unreal engine bloat,  
so I started a smaller game prototype from scratch in Odin,  
using simple libraries and tooling.

I’m currently building and testing prototypes to figure out the project’s scope.  
I’ll post updates here once things are more settled.
