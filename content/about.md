I am a passionate software engineer that enjoys pushing the current technological boundaries with multiple years of professional software engineering & development.
I'm driven by challenges that require creative thinking and structured solutions.

I have had practical experiences delivering complex and reliable systems with small teams while maintaining high efficiency.
I naturally take responsibility for the work's quality, which has led me to participate in architectural decisions.
